## Motivation

I'm creating this repo to have a place to store my learnings about Algorithms and Data Structures.
I'll start writing in Javascript since I have more familiarity with it. I am hoping to expand this into different languages in the future.

Starting with these until I need to organize them later:

DATA STRUCTURES:

- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Doubly Linked List
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Priority Queue
- [ ] Trie
- [ ] Tree
- [ ] Graph

ALGORITHMS:

- [ ] Sort: Bubble Sort
- [ ] Sort: Merge Sort
- [ ] Sort: Insertion
- [ ] Search: Binary Search
- [ ] Search: Jump Search
- [ ] Shuffle: Fisher-Yates
